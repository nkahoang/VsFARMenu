**(Visual Studio Find and Replace extension).**

This extension adds additional "Find in..." and "Replace in..." to quickly open Visual Studio's native Find And Replace dialog in a folder, project or solution in Solution Explorer. This functions similarly to other editor's "Find in folder" and "Replace in folder" those are missing in VS.
